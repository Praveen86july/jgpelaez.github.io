One of the good practices for a datacenter or a cloud infrastructure is to have the [infrastructure as code]
(http://www.thoughtworks.com/es/insights/blog/infrastructure-code-reason-smile).
There are many different options in the market as CloudFormation, Heat, etc to create and provision the insfrastucture and code. 
On internet we can find different comparisons for the tools:

- [thoughtworks.com](http://www.thoughtworks.com/es/insights/blog/choosing-right-tool-provision-aws-infrastructure)
- [ypoonawala.wordpress.com](https://ypoonawala.wordpress.com/2014/12/14/terraform-vs-cloudformation-a-comparison-of-infra-management-tools/)
- [www.terraform.io](https://www.terraform.io/intro/vs/index.html)
 
In this article it's going to be explained how to create a simple infrastructure in [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).
The sample application will have an [Elastic Load Balancer](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/), an EC2 instance with a WSO2 ESB, and a axis server with a sample service. This sample is based in the [BASIC TWO-TIER AWS ARCHITECTURE](https://www.terraform.io/intro/examples/aws.html) from terraform samples.

# AWS account

The sample can be executed in the [AWS free tier](http://aws.amazon.com/free/) without cost.

First it's necessary to create an account in AWS or use an existing one.

Once we have our AWS account, it's necesary to **[create a secret key](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSGettingStartedGuide/AWSCredentials.html)** on aws.

![Create secret key] (/media/posts/terraform-aws-wso2-esb-docker-sample/aws-iam-create-access-key.png)

This secret key and password will allow to access AWS with the APIs.

# Use of terraform

Terraform can be installed [following the instructions](https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html), but in this case we can avoid it using a docker image doing a search in the **[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)**. Using the docker image it's not needed to install additional software in your computer, and it also allows to use terraform in unsupported operating systems. In a team everybody will use the same version of terraform if we specify it in the execution scripts.

To obtain the docker image, we can pull it, in this case:

```sh
docker pull uzyexe/terraform
```

## Terraform project

In this moment we can create the terraform files (all the tf files will be executed in parallel if there is no dependency between instructions):

### **outputs.tf**: 

Definition for the output to show in the screen

```json
output "ebs_address" {
  value = "${aws_elb.web.dns_name}"
}

output "ec_address" {
  value = "${aws_instance.web.dns_name}"
}

```

### **variables.tf**: 
Definition for some input variables, the keys, and passwords will be parametrized

```json
variable "key_name" {
    description = "Name of the SSH keypair to use in AWS."
}

variable "key_path" {
    description = "Path to the private portion of the SSH key specified."
}

variable "access_key" {}
variable "secret_key" {}

variable "aws_region" {
    description = "AWS region to launch servers."
    default = "eu-west-1"
}

# Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS (x64)
variable "aws_amis" {
    default = {
        eu-west-1 = "ami-5da23a2a"
    }
}

```

### **terraform.tfvars**: 
Replacement for the variables, in this file we put the user data information, for example the user key and password. This file is ignored in the public git repository. We can store this files in private repositories (in bitbucket we can have **[unlimited private repositories for free] (https://bitbucket.org/plans)**)

### **main.tf**: 

Main file with our code for the creation.

In this file it's created an AWS security group, [Elastic Load Balancer] (https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) and an AWS instance.

[Elastic Load Balance Pattern](http://www.cloudcomputingpatterns.org/Elastic_Load_Balancer):
![Elastic Load Balance Pattern] (http://www.cloudcomputingpatterns.org/images/e/ef/Elastic_load_balancer_sketch.png)
 


With the [Elastic Load Balancer] (https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) we would have in the future the possibility to dinamically add more services to our infrastructure. 
The instance is provisioned with simple shell scripts installing Docker images. The machine can be also provisioned with a [custom Amazon Machine Image (AMI)](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/help/200940360) or with a provisioner like **[Packer](https://www.packer.io/)**, **[Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/home)**, **[Chef](https://www.chef.io/)**, **[Puppet](https://puppetlabs.com/)**... 

```json
# Specify the provider and access details
provider "aws" {
    access_key = "${var.access_key}"
    secret_key = "${var.secret_key}"
    region = "${var.aws_region}"
}

# Our default security group to access
# the instances over SSH and HTTP
resource "aws_security_group" "default" {
    name = "terraform_example"
    description = "Used in the terraform"

    # SSH access from anywhere
    ingress {
        from_port = 22
        to_port = 22
        protocol = "tcp"
        cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    }

    # HTTP access from anywhere
    ingress {
        from_port = 443
        to_port = 443
        protocol = "tcp"
        cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    }
    
    # HTTP access from anywhere
    ingress {
        from_port = 80
        to_port = 80
        protocol = "tcp"
        cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    }

    # outbound internet access
    egress {
        from_port = 0
        to_port = 0
        protocol = "-1"
        cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    }
}


resource "aws_elb" "web" {
  name = "terraform-example-elb"

  # The same availability zone as our instance
  availability_zones = ["${aws_instance.web.availability_zone}"]

  listener {
    instance_port = 80
    instance_protocol = "http"
    lb_port = 80
    lb_protocol = "http"
  }
  
  # The instance is registered automatically
  instances = ["${aws_instance.web.id}"]
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # The connection block tells our provisioner how to
  # communicate with the resource (instance)
  connection {
    # The default username for our AMI
    user = "ubuntu"

    # The path to your keyfile
    key_file = "${var.key_path}"
  }

  instance_type = "t1.micro"

  # Lookup the correct AMI based on the region
  # we specified
  ami = "${lookup(var.aws_amis, var.aws_region)}"

  # The name of our SSH keypair you've created and downloaded
  # from the AWS console.
  #
  # https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-2#KeyPairs:
  #
  key_name = "${var.key_name}"

  # Our Security group to allow HTTP and SSH access
  security_groups = ["${aws_security_group.default.name}"]

  # We run a remote provisioner on the instance after creating it.
  provisioner "file" {
      source = "./wso2-esb/"
      destination = "/tmp/"
  }	
provisioner "remote-exec" {
   inline = [
        "sh /tmp/install-docker.sh",
        "sh /tmp/download-docker-images.sh",        
        "sh /tmp/run-axis-server.sh",
        "sh /tmp/run-esb.sh"
    ]
  }
}
```
The shell scripts for provision the machine are simple scripts, creating an axis service and using the WSO2 ESB as a proxy.
The idea of this machine is to create an stateless machine, the ESB will proxy all the conections and do a logging (in the sample only in the log file, but can be in a remote statefull service). Following the [stateless machine pattern]((http://www.cloudcomputingpatterns.org/Stateless_Component)) we can add an remove dinamically services depending on the traffic. And the provision and scalate will be really simple.

![Stateless Pattern] (http://www.cloudcomputingpatterns.org/images/2/29/Stateless_component_sketch.png)

The shell script are:

- **install-docker.sh**: 
```sh
#!/bin/sh
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
echo added user to docker group
```

This script executes the installation of docker and adds the user in the docker group.

- **run-axis-server.sh**: 

```sh
#!/bin/sh
. /tmp/set-env.sh

sudo docker rm -f $AXIS_SERVER_NAME
sudo docker rm -f wso2-esb-samples-as

#Creates a container 
sudo docker run -d --name wso2-esb-samples-as -v $WSO2_ESB_PATH \
 jgpelaez/wso2-esb /bin/bash

mkdir -p target

axis_server_pid=$(sudo docker run \
  -d  \
  --volumes-from wso2-esb-samples-as \
  --name $AXIS_SERVER_NAME \
  webratio/ant sh $WSO2_ESB_SAMPLES_PATH/axis2Server/axis2server.sh -name $AXIS_SERVER_NAME)
  
echo "container id". $axis_server_pid
sudo docker exec -d $axis_server_pid ant -f $WSO2_ESB_SAMPLES_PATH/axis2Server/src/SimpleStockQuoteService/build.xml
```

This script executes a docker container with an ant execution with an axis server. The execution code is in a volume with the WSO2 ESB samples.


- **run-axis-server.sh**: 

```sh
#!/bin/sh
. /tmp/set-env.sh

sudo docker rm -f wso2-esb-samples

sudo docker build -t jgpelaez/wso2-esb-samples ../utils/esb/

sudo docker run  \
	-d  \
	-p 443:9443 -p 80:8280 \
	-v $WSO2_ESB_PATH \
	--link wso2-esb-samples-axis-server:wso2-esb-samples-axis-server \
	--name wso2-esb-samples \
	jgpelaez/wso2-esb $WSO2_ESB_PATH/bin/wso2esb-samples.sh -sn 0
```

Runs a docker container with a WSO2 ESB configured with the sample number 0. The https port will be exposed outside, and the execution port 8280 with the 80 port. 
The --link will create a link with the axis server, and the axis server port doesn't needs to expose the ports outside docker.

## Terraform execution

Before the execution, as it's necesary ssh access to the EC2 instance we need to create a key pair in the AWS console, going to EC2 dashboard, Network & security:
![Create key pair](/media/posts/terraform-aws-wso2-esb-docker-sample/aws-create-key-pair.png)

Will create a ".pem" file, this file will allow to access terraform throught ssh.

### Execution plan:

The terraform plan command is used to create an execution plan. Our first execution will be:

```sh
docker run \
	--rm \
	-v $(pwd):/data \
	-v /home/jgpelaez/git/ec2-instance/data/:/data-ssl \
    uzyexe/terraform plan \
    -var 'key_name=keypar2' -var 'key_path=/data-ssl/keypar2.pem'
```

With -v it¬¥s sharing the host folders with the containers, the /data for the .tf files and the /data-ssl the key ar previously created.
The execution will create an initial plan file called **terraform.tfstate**

After the creation of the plan, can be applied and create the real infrastructure with the instruction apply:

```sh
docker run \
	--rm \
	-v $(pwd):/data \
	-v /home/jgpelaez/git/ec2-instance/data/:/data-ssl \
    uzyexe/terraform apply \
    -var 'key_name=keypar2' -var 'key_path=/data-ssl/keypar2.pem'
```

Will create the infrasctucture in the AWS, and print the ouput variables:

![terraform-apply-finised.png] (/media/posts/terraform-aws-wso2-esb-docker-sample/terraform-apply-finised.png)

In the ASW console will appear all the structure defined in the **.tf** files, a new running instance, one volume, a new Load Balancer and a new group:

![aws-instances.png] (/media/posts/terraform-aws-wso2-esb-docker-sample/aws-instances.png)

Checking the instance detail can obtain the public DNS, the WSO2 ESB management console is not exposed throught the load balancer, and normally it should be restricted to be acceded with an ip in a security group.

![aws-instances.png] (/media/posts/terraform-aws-wso2-esb-docker-sample/aws-instance-detail.png)

We can see in detail the security group:

![aws-security-groups.png] (/media/posts/terraform-aws-wso2-esb-docker-sample/aws-security-groups.png)

We can see in detail the Elastic Load Balancer:

![aws-elb.png] (/media/posts/terraform-aws-wso2-esb-docker-sample/aws-elb.png)

And with the public DNS for the ec2 instance we can check if the WSO2 ESB admin console is running (user and password are the default admin/admin)

![logs] (/media/posts/terraform-aws-wso2-esb-docker-sample/wso2-esb-console.png)

### Execute a client for the service:

As we are using the samples from WSO2, it's possible to use the sample client. It can be executed in our local system, and will demonstrate if all the infrastrucure is correctly working.

In local can be also executed with docker, using the script **/wso2-esb/run-client.sh**:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
. ./set-env.sh

WSO_ESB_SAMPLES_SERVER_NAME=$1

export CLIENT_ARGUMENTS="-Daddurl=http://$AXIS_SERVER_NAME:9000/services/SimpleStockQuoteService \
   -Dtrpurl=http://$WSO_ESB_SAMPLES_SERVER_NAME/"
   	
echo Running wso2 client sample with arguments: $CLIENT_ARGUMENTS

docker rm -f wso2-esb-samples-client
#Creates a container 
docker run -d --name wso2-esb-samples-client -v $WSO2_ESB_PATH \
 jgpelaez/wso2-esb /bin/bash

docker run \
  --volumes-from wso2-esb-samples-client \
  webratio/ant ant stockquote -f $WSO2_ESB_SAMPLES_ClIENT_BUILD \
   $CLIENT_ARGUMENTS
```

The address will be the public DNS of the Elastic Load Balancer:

```sh
sh run-client.sh terraform-example-elb-1103743156.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com
```

And it will show the result of the exection in the server:

![logs] (/media/posts/terraform-aws-wso2-esb-docker-sample/wso2-esb-logs.png)

 
### Remove resources:

Finally we can destroy the resources created in AWS, first we can ask to the plan what is going to be destroyed:

```sh
docker run \
	--rm \
	-v $(pwd):/data \
	-v /home/jgpelaez/git/ec2-instance/data/:/data-ssl \
    uzyexe/terraform plan -destroy \
    -var 'key_name=keypar2' -var 'key_path=/data-ssl/keypar2.pem'
```

And destroy it with the destroy instruction, using docker it's necesary to add the -force flag.

```sh
docker run \
	--rm \
	-v $(pwd):/data \
	-v /home/jgpelaez/git/ec2-instance/data/:/data-ssl \
    uzyexe/terraform destroy \
    -var 'key_name=keypar2' -var 'key_path=/data-ssl/keypar2.pem' \
    -force
```
