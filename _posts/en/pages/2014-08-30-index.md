This is my professional web site and blog. In this blog I will try to explain my transition and trip from the old style enterprise architecture to modern architectures in the cloud. Going throught different topics as continuous integration/deployment/delivery, containerization, DevOps philosophy, microservices, cloud tools, and other topics as HTML5, ESB, etc.

# Inspiration

The name of the site starts inspired on my first name (Juan Carlos) in one of the flemish dialects (Jang). Jan is also my name in old Catalan.

Jang... And the cloud. Inspired by my travel to the cloud technologies, and for the tale "Jack and the beans talk". The trip for Jack ends up in a disaster, I bet mine will end up better, but hoping to find the same adventures in the Cloud technologies.
