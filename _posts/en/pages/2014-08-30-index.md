This is my professional web site and blog. In this blog I will try to explain my transition and trip from the old style enterprise architecture to modern architectures in the cloud. Going throught different topics as continuous integration/deployment/delivery, containerization, DevOps philosophy, microservices, cloud tools, and other topics as HTML5, ESB, etc.

# Inspiration

The name of the site originates from and is inspired by my first name (Juan Carlos) in one of the flemish dialects (in Limburg "Jang").
Jan is also my name in old Catalan.

"Jang… and the cloud".
Inspired by my travel into the cloud technologies, and from the story "Jack and the Beanstalk". The trip for Jack ends up in disaster, I'm convinced mine will end up better, although hoping to encounter similar adventures in the Cloud technologies.
